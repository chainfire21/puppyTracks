# Puppy Tracks

### Problem Statement

There are several apps that allow people to learn about new tricks for their pets, but none seem to help a pet owner organize and actually track their pets progress. I propose to build a web app that will let users store and look at the progress their pet is accomplishing. Daily routines and how much time spent training the dog on specific trick will all be logged and help tell the owner when they can go to the next trick, some of which have certain lessons that need to be learned before progressing.
